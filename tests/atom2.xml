In lua.
For fun!!</p>

<p>It's called <em>lam</em>, which could be</p>
<ul>
<li>short for a <b>L</b>isp <b>A</b>cdw <b>M</b>ade</li>
<li>a reversal of MAL, the popular <em>make a lisp</em> project</li>
<li>the thing you go on when a <em>scheme goes wrong</em></li>
<li>.... other things .... ????</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Anyway</em>, in this series I'm going to take you on a tour
of all the parts of lam, from the reader to the types to evaluating
and all the rest.
Along the way, I'll talk about my successes, failures, false starts,
and everything else that comes with trying something new.
Stay tuned, yall :)
</p>
<h2>general plan for posts</h2>
<p>I'm planning on covering each lua module in
<a href="https://git.acdw.net/lam">lam</a> in turn,
and in roughly this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>read</b>, where I convert program text into a lisp structure
(one of the benefits of lisp is that the AST <i>is</i> the code)
</li>
<li><b>type</b>, where I define all the types of the language
as well as a few utility functions</li>
<li><b>eval</b>, where the read-in forms are evaluated to produce a
value</li>
<li><b>load</b> and <b>repl</b>,
closely-related modules that marry read, type, and eval
to load files and, you know, run a repl.</li>
<li><b>core</b>, the primitive environment of lam</li>
</ol>
<p>You may notice other files in the repo.
They are either leftovers from rewrites
&ndash; which I plan on eventually rewriting themselves &ndash;
or vendored dependencies:
specifically <a href="https://github.com/meepen/Lua-5.1-UTF-8/">utf8</a>.</p>
<p>Modules I still want to write but either need rewriting or ... writing include</p>
<ul>
<li><b>test</b>, the test suite</li>
<li><b>lang</b>, a macro library</li>
<li><b>errs</b> (or maybe <b>oops</b>), an error & debugging library</li>
<li>... probably others</li>
</ul>
<p>That leaves one file unaccounted for:</p>
<h2>util.lua</h2>
<p>Since the util module isn't long or important enough for its own post,
I'll quickly talk about it here.
I hope to keep shrinking the size of util until I can delete this file
(and section on this page) altogether.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>util.error(desc, ...)</code></dt>
<dd>This function wraps lua's <code>error</code> to make writing errors a
little easier on myself.
I'm not sure how helpful this is, really.
I need to write another error-handling library to really make it work.
</dd>
<dt><code>util.pop(tbl)</code></dt>
<dd>Another convenience fuction.
Lua's <code>table.remove</code> removes an element from a table,
but by default it removes it from the end.
<code>pop</code> removes it from the beginning.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>shitty lisp club</h2>
<p>I'm part of a little club where we're writing shitty lisps.
Check us out at the
<a href="https://tilde.zone/tags/shittylisp">#shittylisp hashtag</a> on fedi!
(I think I've linked that right .. that's federation for you.)</p></main>]]></content>

<content type="html"><![CDATA[<main><p>You may've noticed it's been a while since I've written anything about my wm in
scheme.  That's because it's become <b>sofaware</b>, or softwares that have
landed, comfortably, softly,
on the <a href="https://tilde.town/~dozens/sofa/">sofa</a>.</p>
<p>I have a lot of softwear on the sofa.
In fact if you look at my <a href="https://git.acdw.net/">git thing</a>,
you'll see plenty of projects that I've rested on the sofa.
It's okay to set things on the sofa and maybe (or maybe not!)
pick them back up again.</p>
<p>This post has been inspired specifically by my project
<a href="https://git.acdw.net/subtext">subtext</a>,
which is an attempt at a groff-like,
flexible document preparator using only POSIX shell and awk.
It's a good idea,
but it's a pain to keep track of all the state I need to to render correctly,
and because of the layers of awk and shell that eventually generate html,
it's <em>really hard</em> to debug issues.</p>
<p>Even before I get to that problem though,
I have the issue that I don't <em>really</em> know how I would organize it.
There are a lot of options and I haven't fully thought them all out
and decided on the best one.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I've just lost interest in the thing.
I keep trying to rewrite it,
but keep getting frustrated.
So on the sofa it has gone, and maybe later, it'll come off again.</p>
<p>And that's okay.</p></main>]]></content>
